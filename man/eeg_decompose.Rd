\description{
Implements a selection of Generalized Eigenvalue based decomposition methods
for EEG signals. Intended for isolating oscillations at specified
frequencies, decomposing channel-based data into components reflecting
distinct or combinations of sources of oscillatory signals. Currently,
spatio-spectral decomposition (Nikulin, Nolte, & Curio, 2011) and Rhythmic
Entrainment Source Separation (Cohen & Gulbinate, 2017) are implemented. The
key difference between the two is that the former returns the results of the
data-derived spatial filters applied to the bandpass-filtered "signal" data,
whereas the latter returns the results of the filters applied to the
original, broadband data.
